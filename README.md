💡 What is Discovery Box?
Discovery Box is a safe, confidential online platform that empowers students to speak up when facing challenges in their school, home, or personal life.

It’s designed to:

🧠 Listen without judgment

🧍🏽 Support with care

🛡️ Protect students from harm by taking early action

📦 Why “Discovery Box”?
Because sometimes students:

Keep things bottled up inside

Are afraid to speak up in person

Feel like they have no one to turn to

The Discovery Box acts like a virtual suggestion box, but instead of ideas — it accepts real concerns, pain, or problems. And unlike a suggestion box, this one listens, responds, and helps.

🛠️ How It Works
Students visit a web page and fill out a private report

They choose how they want to be contacted

The report is safely delivered to trusted support staff

Staff take action or reach out to help — before things escalate

🌟 The Mission of Discovery Box:
To give every student a safe voice, early support, and the courage to ask for help.
